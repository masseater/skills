# Measuring on Cloudflare

Turn on
[Workers
tracing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/traces/)
with `observability.traces.enabled`. Cloudflare then makes spans for outbound
fetches and for calls to KV, R2, D1, Durable Objects and other Workers. No SDK
is needed.

Turn on
[Workers Issues](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/issues/)
with `observability.issues.enabled`. It groups uncaught exceptions, 5xx
responses and logged errors into issues, so a failure in production is recorded
before anyone reports it. It is off by default and records only traffic after it
is turned on. Log a handled error with `console.error()` to make it an issue.

For an app on Effect, TanStack Start and Elysia, add
[`@r_masseater/workers-tracing`](https://github.com/masseater/masseater.dev/tree/main/libs/workers-tracing).
Effect spans, requests, server functions and Elysia routes then join the
platform's own spans in one trace. Do not build an Effect tracer
or a span middleware per repository.

In an Alchemy stack, pass the providers through its `withWorkersTracing({
destinations })`, which also turns on Issues. Do not write `observability` and a
compatibility date on each Worker. A Worker added later is then traced without
anyone remembering to. Run every Effect with its `run` or `runner`, and import
`Elysia` from it. Add its oxlint preset, so that code which skips tracing fails
the lint.

To check spans in CI, deploy its `traceSink` once per account. Then run
`workers-traces --request <url> --expect <span> --wait <seconds>` after each
deploy. A span that stops arriving then fails the deploy job.

Send traces and logs to an OTLP backend through
[export
destinations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/exporting-opentelemetry-data).
Make one destination per signal in the dashboard, and name it in the Worker
configuration. Export needs a paid Workers plan, and metrics cannot be exported
yet. Set `persist: false` to send without keeping a copy in the dashboard.

Read the timing of Workers spans with care. The runtime advances the clock only
on I/O, so some spans show a duration of zero. Calls through service bindings
and to Durable Objects start separate traces.

For D1, query the
[GraphQL Analytics
API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/observability/metrics-analytics).
`d1QueriesAdaptiveGroups` lists queries with their time, rows read and rows
written. `wrangler d1 insights` ranks the same data from the command line. The
command is experimental, so its options may change.

For what real visitors experience, use Cloudflare Web Analytics.
